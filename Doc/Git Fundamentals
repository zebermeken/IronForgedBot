As this whole project is located in GitHub, you first need a Github account and some additonal programs to get started.
This will all be under the assumption you are using VScode with an Ubuntu Linux VM. Please reference the "Setting up Linux with Windows Tools" Document for more of that.
It also assumes you name your repo IronForgedBot, if you have named it something else, then change the following commands to suit that.

Sign up for GitHub
https://github.com/

For basic git functionality download and install Git:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

URL for IronForgedBot:
https://github.com/IronForgedClan/IronForgedBot

###For initially setting up Git and GitHub, the best practice for learning would be to open up Terminal in VSCode after turning on the Ubuntu VM and performing the steps for the following processes. In VSCode you will be prompted to log in and authenticate. There are additional steps to authenticate using Git Bash 

##Set a global username and e-mail address (Use the ones associated to your github account for easiest tracking)
```sh
git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```

##Fork the IronForgedBot from the original source to your GitHub account using the above URL:
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo


##Add your IronForgedBot Repository to your local server
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IronForgedBot
```

Following this you can add upstreams for fetch/pull requests to the mmain repository as well to keep your fork synced with the main repository.
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/IronForgedClan/IronForgedBot
```

###Now, you should have the IronForgedBot on your local machine/VM. From here you should be able to get started with the bot. README.txt contains all the steps to update the IronForgedBot to get it running. 

##When making updates to your repository, it is recommended to learn how to create new branches either through GitHub or the terminal to create a historical list of changes as you update the bot.
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository

#In the terminal, use this command to create a new branch:
```sh
git branch <branchname>
```

#Use Git Checkout to move to that branch:
```sh
git checkout <branchname>
```

#Use Git Add to add your change to the branch:
```sh
git add <updated_file>
```

#View your change to the branch:
```sh
git status
```

#Use Git Commit to finalize adding the file to your branch:
```sh
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
```

#Push your branch to your github repo:

```sh
git push -u origin <branchname>
```

#Checkout back to the main repo and merge with updated branch after confirming your change
```sh
git checkout main
git merge <branchname>
```
